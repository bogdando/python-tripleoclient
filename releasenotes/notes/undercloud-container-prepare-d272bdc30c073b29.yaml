    Parameters for undercloud container images can now be populated during the
    run of `openstack undercloud install --use-heat`. This is controlled by the
    new `undercloud.conf` options:

    * container_image_namespace
    * container_image_name_prefix
    * container_image_name_suffix
    * container_image_tag
    * container_image_tag_from_label

    If the option `container_images_file` is set then the above options are
    ignored. Generally default values will be sufficient, resulting in the
    undercloud being deployed with the recommended images using versioned tags.
